
VMs vs Containers

VMs do not make the best use of space.

Apps are not isolated which could cause config conflicts, security problems, or resource hogging.

Containers allow you to run multiple apps which are virtually isolated from each other.

Launch new containers and configure OS Dependencies per container.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
What is the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?

TCO is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or service.

Creating a TCO report is useful when your company is looking to migrate from on-premise to cloud.

According to research stated by Garter:

“cloud services can initially be more expensive than running on-premises data centers. [However, it also proves that] cloud services can become cost-effective over time if organizations learn to use and operate them more efficiently”

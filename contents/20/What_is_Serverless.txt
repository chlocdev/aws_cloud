What is Serverless?

Serverless architecture generally describes fully managed cloud services.

The classification of a cloud service being serverless is not a Boolean answer (yes or no), but an answer on a scale where a cloud service has a degree of serverless.

A serverless service could have all or most of the following characteristics:

    Highly elastic and scalable
    Highly available
    Highly durable
    Secure by default

Abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and are billed based on the execution of your business task.

Serverless can Scale-to-Zero meaning when not in use the serverless resources cost nothing.

Pay-for-Value (you donâ€™t pay for idle servers).

An analogy of serverless could be similar to an energy rating labels which allows consumers to compare the energy efficiency of a product. Some services are more serverless than others.

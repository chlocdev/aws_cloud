What is AWS Step Functions?

    Coordinate multiple AWS Services into a serverless workflow
    A graphical console to visualize the components of your application as a series of steps.
    Automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected, every time
    logs the state of each step, so when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly

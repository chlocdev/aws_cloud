What is Pub/Sub?

Publishâ€“subscribe pattern commonly implemented in messaging systems.
In a pub/sub system the sender of messages (publishers) do not send their messages directly to receivers.
They instead send their messages to an event bus. The event bus categorizes their messages into groups.
Then receivers of messages (subscribers) subscribe to these groups.
Whenever new messages appear within their subscription the messages are immediately delivered to them.

Use Case: a real-time chat system. A web-hook system

    Publisher have no knowledge of who their subscribers are.
    Subscribers do not pull for messages.
    Messages are instead automatically and immediately pushed to subscribers.
    Messages and events are interchangeable terms in pub/sub

What is Application Integration?

Application Integration is the process of letting two independent applications communicate and work with each other, commonly facilitated by an intermediate system.

Cloud workloads encourage systems and services to be loosely coupled and so AWS has many services for the specific purpose of application integration.

The common systems or design patterns utilized for Application Integration generally are:

    Queueing
    Streaming
    Pub/Sub
    API Gateways
    State Machine
    Event Bus

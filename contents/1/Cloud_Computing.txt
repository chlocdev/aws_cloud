
Cloud Computing

The "textbook" definition of Cloud Computing:

Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than on a local server or personal computer.

Cloud computing allows companies or individuals to rent the resources they need for their companies or personal projects like storage space.

Companies no longer have to purchase physical hardware with expensive IT departments.

This has helped a lot of smaller companies launch their projects or services quickly.

Companies can adjust the types of services they need on demand instead of waiting weeks or longer for new servers or other equipment to scale their businesses.

Individuals no longer need a computer with a huge hard drive for photos or files. They can now store these on services like Google Drive.
On-premise On-premises vs Cloud Providers

On-premise On-premises

    You own the servers
    You hire the IT people
    You pay or rent the real-estate
    You take all the risk.

Cloud Providers

    Someone else owns the servers
    Someone else hires the IT people
    Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
    You are responsible for configuring your cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

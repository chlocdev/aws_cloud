Cloud Computing Deployment Models

There are three different types of deployment models for Cloud Computing.
Cloud

When you think of Cloud, think of small startups.
Cloud Deployment

    100% of IT infrastructure is on the cloud.
    All of a companies applications were migrated to or created on the cloud.
    Helps to remove roadblocks of costly and time consuming procurement processes for on-premises infrastructure (big servers and data centers!).
    Great for small businesses and start-ups.

Hybrid

When you think of Hybrid, think of Fin Tech Companies
Hybrid Deployment

    Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources
    Great for established companies that had a dedicated data center but also wants to migrate processes over to the cloud
    Data is partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises
    Popular in the Fin Tech space

On-Premise

When you think of On-premise, think of large old companies or companies that are beholden to Government Regulations.
On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment

    Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers.
    Resembles traditional IT infrastructure with big servers, data centers, etc.
    Do not get the same benefits of cloud computing (ability to easily scale up and down on demand)
    Company has dedicated resources that are not shared with others(good for security)
    Resources cannot be accessed using the internet
    Typically older large companies or owned by Government organizations

Types of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing models

There are three main models of Cloud Computing:

    SaaS - Software as a Service
    PaaS- Platform as a Service
    IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service (Host)

Most basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure. It has the most flexibility and management control of all the different cloud computing models. It is the closest to having a traditional on-premises data center.

Examples:

    Amazon Web Services
    Microsoft Azure
    Google Cloud

PaaS- Platform as a Service (Build)

Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Less flexibility than IaaS because of pre-constructed packages.

Examples:

    AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    Windows Azure
    Heroku
    Google App Engine

SaaS- Software as a Service (Consume)

Completed projects managed by a service provider. Easy to use and comes complete with a user interface. Least flexibility

Examples:

    Gmail
    Adobe Creative Cloud

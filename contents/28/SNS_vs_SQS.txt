The Both Connect Apps via Messages

Simple Notifications Service

Pass Along Messages eg. PubSub

Send notifications to subscribers of topics via multiple protocols. eg, HTTP, Email, SQS, SMS

SNS is generally used for sending plain text emails which are triggered via other AWS Services. The best example of this is billing alarms.

Can retry sending in case of failure for HTTPS

Really good for webhooks, simple internal emails, triggering Lambda functions

Simple Queue Service

Queue Up Messages, Guaranteed Delivery

Places messages into a queue. Applications pull queue using AWS SDK

    Can retain a message for up to 14 days
    Can send them in sequential order or in parallel
    Can ensure only one message is sent
    Can ensure messages are delivered at least once

Really good for delayed tasks, queueing up emails

AWS Elastic Beanstalk

What is Platform as a Service? (PaaS)

a PaaS allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app

Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS for deploying web applications with little-to-no knowledge of the underlying infrastructure so you can focus on writing application code instead of setting up an automated deployment pipeline and DevOps tasks.

Choose a platform, upload your code and it runs with little knowledge of the infrastructure.

Not Recommended for “Production” applications

AWS is talking about enterprises, large companies.

Elastic Beanstalk is powered by a CloudFormation template and setups for you:

    Elastic Load Balancer
    Autoscaling Groups
    RDS Database
    EC2 Instance preconfigured (or custom ) platforms
    Monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS)
    In-Place and Blue/Green deployment methodologies
    Security (Rotates passwords)
    Can run Dockerized environments

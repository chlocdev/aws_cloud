EC2 Instance Types

An instance type is a particular instance size and instance family:

A common pattern for instance sizes:

    nano
    micro
    small
    medium
    large
    xlarge
    2xlarge
    4xlarge
    8xlarge
    ….

There are many exceptions to this pattern for sizes e.g.

    c6g.metal – is a bare metal machine.
    C5.9xlarge – Is not a power of 2 or even number size

EC2 Instance Sizes

EC2 Instance Sizes generally double in price and key attributes

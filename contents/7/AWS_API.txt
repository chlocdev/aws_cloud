AWS API

What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?

An API is software that allows two applications/services to talk to each other. The most common type of API is via HTTP/S requests.

AWS API is an HTTP API and you can interact by sending HTTPS requests, using an application interacting with APIs like Postman.

Each AWS Service has its own Service Endpoint which you send requests

GET / HTTP/1.1
host: monitoring.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
x-amz-target: GraniteServiceVersion20100801.GetMetricData
x-amz-date: 20180112T092034Z
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=REDACTEDREDACTED/20180411/â€¦..
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Content-Encoding: amz-1.0
Content-Length: 45
Connection: keep-alive

To authorize use you will need generate a signed request You make a separate request with your AWS credentials and get back a token.

You need to also provide an ACTION and accompanying parameters as the payload

Rarely do users directly send HTTP requests directly to the AWS API. Its much easier to interact with the API via a variety of Developer Tools

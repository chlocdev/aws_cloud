Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

You write a configuration script to automate creating, updating, or destroying cloud infrastructure.

    IaC is a blueprint of your infrastructure.
    IaC allows you to easily share, version, or inventory your cloud infrastructure.

AWS has two offerings for writing Infrastructure as Code.

AWS CloudFormation (CFN)

CFN is a Declarative IaC tool

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

CDK is an Imperative IaC tool.

Declarative

    You say what you want, and the rest is filled in. Implicit Explicit
    More verbose, but zero chance of misconfiguration
    Uses scripting languages eg. JSON, YAML, XML

Imperative

    What you see is what you get. Explicit Implicit
    Less verbose, you could end up with misconfiguration
    Does more than Declarative
    Uses programming languages eg. Python, Ruby, JavaScript

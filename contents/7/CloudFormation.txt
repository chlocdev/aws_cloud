CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation allows you to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as either a JSON or YAML file.

CloudFormation is simple but it can lead to large files or is limited in some regard to creating dynamic or repeatable infrastructure compared to CDK.

CloudFormation can be easier for DevOps Engineers who do not have a background in web programming languages.

Since CDK generates out CloudFormation it's still important to be able to read and understand CloudFormation in order to debug IaC stacks.

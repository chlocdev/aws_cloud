Access Keys

Access Keys is a key and secret required to have programmatic access to AWS resources when interacting with the AWS API outside of the AWS Management Console

An Access Key is commonly referred to as AWS Credentials

A user must be granted access to use Access Keys

    Never share your access keys
    Never commit access keys to a codebase
    You can have two active Access Keys
    You can deactivate Access Keys
    Access Keys have whatever access a user has to AWS resources. 

Access Keys are to be store in ~/.aws/credentials and follow a TOML file format

Default will be the access key used when no profile is specified.

You can store multiple access keys by giving the profile names.

You can use the aws configure CLI command to populate the credential file.

The AWS SDK will automatically read from these environment variables.

This is the safe way of using an Access Key within your code.

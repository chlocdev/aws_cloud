Global Infrastructure â€“ Point of Presence (PoP)

The following AWS Services use PoPs for content delivery or expediated upload.

Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that:

    You point your website to CloudFront so that it will route requests to nearest Edge Location cache
    allows you to choose an origin (such as a web-server or storage) that will be source of cached
    caches the contents of what origin would returned to various Edge Locations around the world

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration allows you to generate a special URL that can be used by end users to upload files to a nearby Edge Location. Once a file is uploaded to an Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3.

AWS Global Accelerator can find the optimal path from the end user to your web-servers. Global Accelerator are deployed within Edge Locations so you send user traffic to an Edge Location instead of directly to your web-application.

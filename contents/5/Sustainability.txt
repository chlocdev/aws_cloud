AWS Cloud’s Sustainability goals are composed of three parts:

1. Renewable Energy

AWS is working towards having its AWS Global Infrastructure powered by 100% renewable energy by 2025.

AWS purchases and retires environmental attributes to cover the non-renewable energy for AWS Global Infrastructure:

    Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
    Guarantees of Origin (GOs)

2. Cloud Efficiency

AWS’s infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy-efficient than the median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed.

3. Water Stewardship

Direct evaporative technology to cool our data center Use of non-potable water for cooling purposes (recycled water)

On-site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles Water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region

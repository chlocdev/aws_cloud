Points of Presence

Points of Presence (PoP) are intermediate locations between an AWS Region and the end-user, and this location could be a datacenter or collection of hardware.​

    For AWS a Point of Presence is a data center owned by AWS or a trusted partner that is utilized by AWS Services related for content delivery or expediated upload.​

Edge Locations - are datacenters that hold cached (copy) on the most popular files (eg. web pages, images and videos) so that the delivery of distance to the end users are reduce

Regional Edge Cache - are datacenters that hold much larger caches of less-popular files to reduce a full round trip and also to reduce the cost of transfer fees.​
The following AWS Services use PoPs for content delivery or expediated upload:

AWS CloudFront - is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that:​

    You point your website to CloudFront so that it will route requests to the nearest Edge Location cache​

    Allows you to choose an origin (such as a web-server or storage) that will be a source of cached​

    Caches the contents of what origin would be returned to various Edge Locations around the world​

AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration - allows you to generate a special URL that can be used by end users to upload files to a nearby Edge Location. Once a file is uploaded to an Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3.​

AWS Global Accelerator - can find the optimal path from the end user to your web-servers. Global Accelerators are deployed within Edge Locations so you send user traffic to an Edge Location instead of directly to your web-application.​

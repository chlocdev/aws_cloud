Regions

Region: a Geographically Distinct Location, which has multiple datacentres(AZs).

Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply

    Each region has at least two Availability Zones (AZs) ​
    AWS US-EAST-1 (North Virginia) is the largest region​
    New services almost always become available first in US-EAST​
    Not all AWS Services are available in all regions​
    All your billing information appears in US-EAST-1 (North Virginia)​
    AWS is always looking to expand their footprint so new regions could be added in the upcoming years.​

You can head over to AWS's Global Infrastructure page to learn more about Regions and see maps of their locations.

    In the AWS Console you can change AWS Regions. Whatever AWS resources you launch will be in that region.​
    Some AWS Services such as CloudFront operate in multiple regions and you’ll see the region change to Global ​

When you choose a region, there are four factors you need to consider:

    What Regulatory Compliance does this region meet?
    What is the cost of the AWS services in this region?
    What AWS services are available in this region?
    What is the distance or latency to my end-users?

Global Infrastructure â€“ AWS in China

AWS China is the AWS cloud offerings in Mainland China.

AWS China is completely isolate intentionally from AWS Global to meet regulatory compliance for Mainland China.

AWS China is on its own domain at: amazonaws.cn

In order to operate in a AWS China Region you need have a Chinese Business License (ICP license) Not all services are available in china eg. Route53 Running in Mainland China (instead of Singapore) means you would not need to traverse the The Great Firewall.

AWS has two Regions in Mainland China:

Ningxia CN-NorthWest-1 Operated by NSWCF

Beijing CN-North-1 operated by SINNET

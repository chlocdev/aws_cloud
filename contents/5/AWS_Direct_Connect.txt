AWS Direct Connect

A co-location (aka carrier-hotel) is a data center where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers

Helps reduce network costs and increase bandwidth throughput. (great for high traffic networks)

Provides a more consistent network experience than a typical internet-based connection. (reliable and secure)

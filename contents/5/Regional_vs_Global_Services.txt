Global Infrastructure - Regional vs Global Services

Regional Services

AWS Scopes their AWS Management Console on a selected Region.

This will determine where an AWS service will be launched and what will be seen within an AWS Service's console

You generally don't explicitly set the Region for service at the time of the creation

Global Services

Some AWS Services operates across multiple regions and the region will be fixed to "Global"

E.g. Amazon S3, Cloud Front, Route53, IAM

For these global services at the time of creation:

    There is no concept of region e.g. IAM User
    A single region must be explicitly chosen e.g. S3 Bucket
    A group of regions is chosen e.g. CloudFront Distribution

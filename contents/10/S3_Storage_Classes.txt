
S3 Storage Classes

AWS offers a range of S3 storage classes that trade Retrieval Time, Accessibility and Durability for Cheaper Storage

S3 Standard (default)

Fast! 99.99% Availability, 11 9’s Durability. Replicated across at least three AZs

S3 Intelligent Tiering

Uses ML to analyze object usage and determine the appropriate storage class. Data is moved to the most cost-effective access tier, without any performance impact or added overhead.

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

Still Fast! Cheaper if you access files less than once a month. Additional retrieval fee is applied. 50% less than Standard (reduced availability)

S3 One-Zone-IA

Still Fast! Objects only exist in one AZ. Availability (is 99.5%). but cheaper than Standard IA by 20% less
(Reduce durability) Data could get destroyed. A retrieval fee is applied.

S3 Glacier

For long-term cold storage. Retrieval of data can take minutes to hours but the off is very cheap storage

S3 Glacier Deep Archive

The lowest cost storage class. Data retrieval time is 12 hours.

Cheaper ↓

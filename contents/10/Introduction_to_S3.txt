What is Object Storage (Object-based Storage)?

data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures such as:

    file systems that manage data as files and fire file hierarchy, and
    block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

S3 provides you with unlimited storage.

You donâ€™t need to think about the underlying infrastructure

The S3 Console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data
S3 Object

Objects contain your data. They are like files.

An object may consist of:

    Key this is the name of the object
    Value the data itself is made up of a sequence of bytes
    Version ID the version of the object (when versioning is enabled)
    Metadata additional information attached to the object

S3 Bucket

Buckets hold objects. Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects

S3 is a universal namespace so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name)

You can store an individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size

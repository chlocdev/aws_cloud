
Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is the computer security concept of providing a user, role, or application the least amount of permissions to perform an operation or action.

Just-Enough-Access (JEA)

Permitting only the exact actions for the identity to perform a task

Just-In-Time (JIT)

Permitting the smallest length of duration an identity can use permissions

ConsoleMe is an open-source Netflix project to self-serve short-lived IAM policies so an end-user can access AWS resources while enforcing JEA and JIT

Risk-based adaptive policies

Each attempt to access a resource generates a risk score of how likely the request is to be from a compromised source. The risk score could be based on many factors e.g. device, user location, IP address what service is being accessed, and when.

AWS at the time of this recording does not have Risk-based adaptative policies built into IAM


Zero Trust on AWS with Third Parties

AWS does technically implement a Zero Trust Model but does not allow for intelligent identity security controls.

For example:

Azure Active Directory has Real-time and calculated risk detection based on more data points than AWS eg:

    Device and Application
    Time of Day
    Location
    MFA turned on
    What is being accessed

And the security controls, verifications, or logic restriction is much more robust.

AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

Your AWS Resources

Third-Party Identity solutions

    Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
    Google BeyondCorp
    JumpCloud

all have more intelligent security controls for real-time detection.

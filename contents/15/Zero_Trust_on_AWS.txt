
Zero Trust on AWS

Identity Security Controls you can implement on AWS to meet the Zero Trust Model

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

    IAM Policies
    Permission Boundaries
    Service Control Policies (Organization-wide Policies)
    IAM Policy Conditions
        aws:SourceIp – Restrict on IP Address
        aws:RequestedRegion – Restrict on Region
        aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent – Restrict if MFA is turned off
        aws:CurrentTime – Restrict access based on time of day

Your AWS Resources

AWS does not have ready-to-use identity controls that are intelligent, which is why AWS is considered to not have a true Zero Trust offering for customers, and third-party services need to be used.

A collection of AWS Services can be setup to intelligent-ish detection of identity concerns but requires expert knowledge

AWS CloudTrail

Tracks all API calls

Amazon GuardDuty

Detects suspicious or malicious activity based on CloudTrail and other logs

Amazon Detective

Used to analyze, investigate and quickly identify security issues (can ingest findings from Guard Duty)

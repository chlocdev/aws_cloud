
LDAP​

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.​

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords​

LDAP enables for same-sign on. The same sign-on allows the same userID and password to be used for multiple applications, but they have to enter it in every time they want to login.​

Why use LDAP when SSO is more convenient?​

Most SSO systems are using LDAP.​

LDAP was not designed natively to work with web applications.​

Some systems only support integration with LDAP and not SSO​

What is a cypher?

An algorithm that performs encryption or decryption. Cipher is synonymous with “code”

A cipher (also spelled "cypher") is a cryptographic technique that encrypts information to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. It scrambles data, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key or algorithm.

What is ciphertext

Ciphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext via an algorithm

Ciphertext is the encrypted form of a message or data resulting from applying encryption to plaintext.

A codebook is a type of document used for gathering and storing cryptography codes

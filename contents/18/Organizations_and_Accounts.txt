Organizations and Accounts

    Organizations allow the creation of new AWS accounts. Centrally manage billing, control access, compliance, security, and share resources across your AWS accounts.

    Root Account User is a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in an account. Each account has a Root Account User

    Organization Units are a group of AWS accounts within an organization which can also contain other organizational units - creating a hierarchy

    Service Control Policies give central control over the allowed permissions for all accounts in your organization, helping to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s guidelines.

AWS Organizations must be turned on, once turned it cannot be turned off.

You can create as many AWS Accounts as you like, one account will be the Master/Root Account

AWS Account is not the same as a User Account

Key Points:

    In AWS you can have more than one account managed through a single account using Organizations

    Organizations allow you to setup consolidated billing where 1 account pays the AWS bill for all

    The payer account is the root level account in an Organization

    You can create isolated AWS accounts for different teams under the payer account - and place them inside Organizational Units (OU)

    The separation of accounts into OUs allows you to set customized permission boundaries on the accounts using Service Control Policies (SCPs)

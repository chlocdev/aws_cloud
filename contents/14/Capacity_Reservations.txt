Capacity Reservations

EC2 instances are backed by a different kind of hardware, and so there is a finite amount of servers available within an Availability Zone per instance type or family.

You go to launch a specific type of EC2 instance but AWS has run out of that server!

Capacity Reservation is a service of EC2 that allows you to request a reserve of EC2 instance type for a specific Region and AZ

The reserved capacity is charged at the selected instance typeâ€™s On-Demand rate whether an instance is running in it or not.

You can also use your regional reserved instances with your Capacity Reservations to benefit from billing discounts

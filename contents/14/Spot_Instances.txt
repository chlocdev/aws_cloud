
Spot Instances

AWS has unused compute capacity that they want to maximize the utility of their idle servers.

Itâ€™s like when a hotel offers booking discounts to fill vacant suites or planes offer discounts to fill vacant seats

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances provide a discount of 90% compared to On-Demand Pricing

Spot Instances can be terminated if the computing capacity is needed by other On-Demand customers

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud.

Designed for applications that have flexible start and end times or applications that are only feasible at very low compute costs.

AWS Batch is an easy and convenient way to use Spot Pricing

Termination Conditions:

    Instances can be terminated by AWS at any time.
    If your instance is terminated by AWS, you don't get charged for a partial hour of usage.
    If you terminate an instance you will still be charged for an hour that it ran.

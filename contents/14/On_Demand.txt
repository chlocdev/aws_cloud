
On Demand

On-Demand is a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model, where you consume compute and then you pay.

When you launch an EC2 instance it is by default On-Demand Pricing

Key Points:

    On-Demand has no up-front payment and no long-term commitment

    You are charged by the hour or by the minute (varies based on EC2 Instance Types

per-second for:

    Linux, Windows, Windows with SQL Enterprise, Windows with SQL Standard, and Windows with SQL Web Instances that do not have a separate hourly charge

per-hour:

    full hour for all other instance types.

When looking up pricing it will always show EC2 pricing is the hourly rate

    On-Demand is for applications where the workload is for short-term, spikey, or unpredictable.

    Used for when you have a new app for development or you want to run an experiment

Operational Excellence Design Principles

Perform operations as code

Apply the same engineering discipline you would to application code to your cloud infrastructure. By treating your operations as code you can limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.

eg. Infrastructure as Code

Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly.

eg. rollbacks, incremental changes, Blue/Green, CI/CD

Refine operations procedures frequently

Look for continuous opportunities to improve your operations

eg. Use game days to simulate traffic or event failure on your production workloads

Anticipate failure

Perform post-mortems on system failures to better improve, write test code, kill production serves to test recovery

Learn from all operational failures

share lessons learned in a knowledge base for operational events and failures across your entire organization

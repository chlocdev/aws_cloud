High Elasticity
What is High Elasticity?

Your ability to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power
How is Elasticity achieved?

Elasticity relies on Horizontal Scaling. Vertical Scaling is generally hard for traditional architecture so you’ll usually only see horizontal scaling described with Elasticity.

Scaling Out — Add more servers of the same size

Scaling In — Removing more servers of the same size
How can Elasticity be implemented in AWS?

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) - are an AWS feature that will automatically add or remove servers based on scaling rules you define.

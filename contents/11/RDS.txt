    MariaDB – When Oracle bought MySQL a fork (copy) of MySQL was made under a different open-source license.​

    Postgres (PSQL) – Most popular open-source SQL database among developers. Has rich-features over MySQL but at added complexity​

    Oracle – Oracle’s proprietary SQL database. Well used by Enterprise companies. You have to buy a license to use it.​

    Microsoft SQL Server – Microsoft’s proprietary SQL database. You have to buy a license to use it.​

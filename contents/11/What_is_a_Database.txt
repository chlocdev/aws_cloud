
What is a Database?

A database is a data store that stores semi-structured and structured data.

A database is a more complex data stores because it requires using formal design and modeling techniques

Databases can be generally categorized as either:

Relational databases

    Structured data that strongly represents tabular data (tables, rows, and columns)
        Row-oriented or Columnar-oriented

Non-relational databases

    Semi-structured that may or may not distantly resemble tabular data.

Databases have a rich set of functionality:

    specialized language to query (retrieve data)
    specialized modeling strategies to optimize retrieval for different use cases
    more fine-tune control over the transformation of the data into useful data structures or reports

Normally, a database infers someone is using a relational row-oriented datastore

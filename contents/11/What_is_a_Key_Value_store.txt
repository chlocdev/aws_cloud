What is a Key / Value store?

A key/value stores a unique key alongside a value

Key values stores are dumb and fast.

They generally lack features like:

    Relationships
    Indexes
    Aggregation 

A simple key/value store will interpret this data resembling a dictionary (aka Associative arrays or hash)

A key/value store can resemble tabular data, it does not have to have consistent columns per row (hence its schemaless)

Due to their simple design, they can scale well beyond a relational database

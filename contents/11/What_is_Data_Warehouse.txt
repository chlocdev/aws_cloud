
What is Data Warehouse?

A relational data store designed for analytic workloads, which is generally column-oriented data-store

Companies will have terabytes and millions of rows of data, and they need a fast way to be able to produce analytics reports

Data warehouses generally perform aggregation

    aggregation is grouping data eg. find a total or average
    Data warehouses are optimized around columns since they need to quickly aggerate column data

Data warehouses are generally designed to be HOT

    Hot means they can return queries very very fast even though they have vast amounts of data

Data warehouses are infrequently accessed meaning they arenâ€™t intended for real-time reporting but maybe once or twice a day or once a week to generate business and user reports.

A data warehouse needs to consume data from a relational database on a regular basis.

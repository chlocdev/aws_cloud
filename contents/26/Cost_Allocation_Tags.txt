Cost Allocation Tags

Cost Allocation Tags are optional metadata that can be attached to AWS resources so when you generate a Cost and Usage Report you can use that data to better analyze your data.

There are two types of tags:

    User-Defined
        Eg Project
    AWS Generated
        E.g. aws:createdBy

You have to activate the tags you want to show up in the report

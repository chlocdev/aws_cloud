AWS Service Level Agreements

DynamoDB SLA

AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make DynamoDB available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage for each AWS region, during any monthly billing cycle, of (a) at least 99.999% if the Global Tables SLA applies, or (b) at least 99.99% if the Standard SLA applies

In the event DynamoDB does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below
	Monthly Uptime Percentage 	Service Credit Percentage
Global Tables SLA 	Less than 99.999% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0%, Less than 95.0% 	10%, 25%, 100%
Standard SLA 	Less than 99.99% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0%, Less than 95.0% 	10%, 25%, 100%

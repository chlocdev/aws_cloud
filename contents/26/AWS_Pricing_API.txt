AWS Pricing API

With AWS you can programmatically access pricing information to get the latest price offering for services.

There are two versions of this API:

    Query API – The Pricing Service API via JSON
    https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    Batch API – The Price List API via HTML
    https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/index.json

 You can also subscribe to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications to get alerts when prices for the services change.

AWS prices change periodically, such as when AWS cuts prices when new instance types are launched, or when new services are introduced

CloudWatch Logs â€” Log Insights

CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your CloudWatch log data and has the following advantages:

    More robust filtering than using the simple Filter events in a Log Stream
    Less burdensome than having to export logs to S3 and analyze them via Athena.

CloudWatch Logs Insights supports all types of logs.

CloudWatch Logs Insights is commonly used via the console to do ad-hoc queries against logs groups.

CloudWatch Insights has its own language called:

    CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax

    A single request can query up to 20 log groups.
    Queries time out after 15 minutes, if they have not been completed.
    Query results are available for 7 days.

AWS provides sample queries that can get you started for common tasks,

And to ease learning the Query Syntax. A good example Is filtering VPC Flow Logs.

You can create and save your own queries to make future repetitive tasks easier.

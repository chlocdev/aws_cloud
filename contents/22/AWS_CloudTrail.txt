AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.

AWS CloudTrail is used to monitor API calls and Actions made on an AWS account.

Easily identify which users and accounts made the call to AWS eg.

    Where — Source IP Address
    When — EventTime
    Who — User, UserAgent
    What — Region, Resource, Action

CloudTrail is already logging by default and will collect logs for the last 90 days via Event History

If you need more than 90 days you need to create a Trail

Trails are output to S3 and do not have GUI like Event History. To analyze a Trail you’d have to use Amazon Athena.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Network where you launch your AWS resources. You choose a range of IPs using CIDR Range

CIDR Range of 10.0.0.0/16 = 65,536 IP Addresses

Subnets a logical partition of an IP network into multiple smaller network segments. You are breaking up your IP range for VPC into smaller networks.

    Subnets need to have a smaller CIDR range than to the VPC represent their portion.â€‹ eg Subnet CIDR Range 10.0.0.0/24 = 256 IP Addresses

Public vs Private Subnets:

Public subnets are generally used for placing resources which are accessible on the internet

Private subnets are used when you need resources to be more secured and only accessible through tightly filtered traffic into the subnet

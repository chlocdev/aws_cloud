Key definitions:

Region - the geographical location of your network

Availability Zone (AZ) - a data center containing your AWS resources

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)- a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources

Internet Gateway- enables access to the Internet for your VPC

Route Tables- determines where network traffic from your subnets are directed

NACLs- Network Access Control Lists. Act as a firewall at the subnet level

Security Groups- Act as firewall at the instance level

Subnets- a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments

Availability Zones:

Availability Zones are the data centers where you launch your AWS resources into

Each AZs is associated with a specific region

Key VPC Components:

A virtual private cloud (VPC) network is your own personal isolated section of the AWS cloud.

A route table contains a set of rules (called routes), that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Internet Gateway- Allows you to grant internet access to resources inside of your VPC. But you also need a route table which routes the traffic from the VPC network out to the IGW

You can think of it as a door from your VPC outward.


What is Edge Computing?​

When you push your computing workloads outside of your networks to run close to the destination location.​

eg. Pushing computing to run on phones, IoT Devices, or external servers not within your cloud network.​
What is Hybrid Computing?​

When you’re able to run workloads on both your on-premise datacenter and AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

AWS Outposts - is physical rack of servers that you can put in your data center. AWS Outposts allows you to use AWS API and Services such as EC2 right in your datacenter.

VMWare Cloud on AWS - allows you to manage on-premise virtual machines using VMWare as EC2 instances.​ The data-center must being using VMWare for Virtualization.

AWS Local Zones - are edge datacenters located outside of an AWS region so you can use AWS closer to end destination.​ When you need faster computing, storage and databases in populated areas that are outside of an AWS Region​

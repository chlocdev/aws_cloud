Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows you to launch Virtual Machines (VM)​. When we launch a Virtual Machine we call it an ”instance”​.

What is a Virtual Machine?​

A Virtual Machine (VM) is an emulation of a physical computer using software. ​

Server Virtualization allows you to easily create, copy, resize or migrate your server.​

Multiple VMs can run on the same physical server so you can share the cost with other customers.​

Imagine if your server or computer was an executable file on your computer

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a predefined configuration for a Virtual Machine.

EC2 is considered the backbone of AWS because the majority of AWS services are using EC2 as their underlying servers. eg. S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambdas

EC2 is a highly configurable server where you can choose AMI that affects options such as:​

    The amount of CPUs​

    The amount of Memory (RAM)​

    The amount of Network Bandwidth​

    The Operation System (OS) eg. Windows 10, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 2​

    Attach multiple virtual hard-drives for storage eg. Elastic Block Store (EBS)​
